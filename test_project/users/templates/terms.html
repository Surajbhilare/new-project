            <p>If you operate a blog, comment on a blog, post material to the Website, post links on the Website, or
              otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available by means of the Website (any such
              material, “Content”), You are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that
              Content. That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an
              audio file, or computer software. By making Content available, you represent and warrant that:

              The downloading, copying and use of the Content will not infringe the proprietary rights, including but
              not limited to the copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret rights, of any third party;
              If your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you have either (i) received permission
              from your employer to post or make available the Content, including but not limited to any software, or
              (ii) secured from your employer a waiver as to all rights in or to the Content;
              you have fully complied with any third-party licenses relating to the Content, and have done all things
              necessary to successfully pass through to end users any required terms;
              the Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or
              destructive content;
              the Content is not spam, is not machine- or randomly-generated, and does not contain unethical or unwanted
              commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of
              third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source
              of the material (such as spoofing);

              email lists, other blogs and web sites, and similar unsolicited promotional methods;
              your blog is not named in a manner that misleads your readers into thinking that you are another person or
              company. For example, your blog’s URL or name is not the name of a person other than yourself or company
              other than your own; and
              you have, in the case of Content that includes computer code, accurately categorized and/or described the
              type, nature, uses and effects of the materials, whether requested to do so by SevenMentor or otherwise.
              By submitting Content to SevenMentor for inclusion on your Website, you grant SevenMentor a world-wide,
              royalty-free, and non-exclusive license to reproduce, modify, adapt and publish the Content solely for the
              purpose of displaying, distributing and promoting your blog. If you delete Content, SevenMentor will use
              reasonable efforts to remove it from the Website, but you acknowledge that caching or references to the
              Content may not be made immediately unavailable.
              Without limiting any of those representations or warranties, SevenMentor has the right (though not the
              obligation) to, in SevenMentor sole discretion (i) refuse or remove any content that, in SevenMentor
              reasonable opinion, violates any SevenMentor policy or is in any way harmful or objectionable, or (ii)
              terminate or deny access to and use of the Website to any individual or entity for any reason, in
              SevenMentor sole discretion. SevenMentor will have no obligation to provide a refund of any amounts
